In Rust, you can't use the + operator to concatenate strings in the same way you might in languages like C# or JavaScript. Rust's type system enforces more strict rules for string manipulation to prevent common runtime errors like buffer overflows and memory unsafety.

To concatenate strings in Rust, you should use the .join() method provided by the std::path::PathBuf type. This method is specifically designed for joining paths and is safer than direct string concatenation because it handles platform-specific path separators.

Here's the reason why your initial attempt current_dir + "test.txt" doesn't work:

1. current_dir is of type std::path::PathBuf, not a String.
2. The + operator is not defined for PathBuf and String.
3. Rust enforces strict type safety, and you cannot directly concatenate different types.

By using .join(), you ensure that the path is correctly constructed with the appropriate separator for your platform, making your code more portable and less error-prone.
